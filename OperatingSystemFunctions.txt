One function of an Operating System is help you control the way you use your computer. 
An OS is made to give the user control over their system, and one of those ways is customization. 
You can move individual programs around, put them in folders, put them into different categories even. 
Most commonly people will just throw their programs onto their desktop or organize photos based on different timeframes.
